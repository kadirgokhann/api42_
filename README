-> a) This module needs 7 core. If you have more than 7 core, its okay. If not,
you need to change the number of core in the file ./src/api2/request.py line 68.
b) 7 is for Certified App.
3 is for Official App.
1 is for Default App.

-> First run this python command to install all the dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

-> Then, in order to use the advantage of this module you need to use Python Intellisense
in your VSCode. For that you need to install the following package:

https://code.visualstudio.com/download
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python

-> You just need to create a file : ./src/credentials/keys.json
Example of that file exists there. You just need to replace the api secret and api key with your own
and correct the name of that file.

If you want to use API on the campus_id 49
{
"\_49_api_key": "xxxxxx",
"\_49_api_secret": "xxx",
"\_49_token": "xxxxxx",
"\_49_tokentime": "23/02/18 09:57:23"
}

    and in the code you can create object like this:
    $api = API(49);

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you want to use API on two campus_ids:

    You need to create a file ./src/credentials/keys.json like
    {
        "_49_api_key": "xxxxxx",
        "_49_api_secret": "xxx",
        "_49_token": "xxxxxx",
        "_49_tokentime": "23/02/18 09:57:23",
        "_50_api_key": "xxxxxx",
        "_50_api_secret": "xxx",
        "_50_token": "xxxxxx",
        "_50_tokentime": "23/02/18 09:57:23"
    }

    You can create object like this:
    $api = API(49);
    $api2 = API(50);
