      -> In the src/credentials/settings.json, there is a key called "token".
      It represents the number of requests in a second.
      7 is for Certified App.

      You can learn the type from https://profile.intra.42.fr/oauth/applications

      -> First run this python command to install all the dependencies
      pip3 install -r requirements.txt

      -> Then, in order to use the advantage of this module you need to use Python Intellisense
      in your VSCode. For that you need to install the following package:

      https://code.visualstudio.com/download
      https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python

      --> You just need to create a file : ./src/credentials/keys.json
      Example of that file exists there. You just need to replace the api secret and api key with your own
      and correct the name of that file.

      If you want to use API on the campus_id 49
      {
            "_49_api_key": "xxxxxx",
            "_49_api_secret": "xxx",
            "_49_token": "xxxxxx",
            "_49_tokentime": "23/02/18 09:57:23"
      }

      and in the code you can create object like this:
      $api = API(49);

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      If you want to use API on two campus_ids:

      You need to create a file ./src/credentials/keys.json like
      {
         "_49_api_key": "xxxxxx",
         "_49_api_secret": "xxx",
         "_49_token": "xxxxxx",
         "_49_tokentime": "23/02/18 09:57:23",
         "_50_api_key": "xxxxxx",
         "_50_api_secret": "xxx",
         "_50_token": "xxxxxx",
         "_50_tokentime": "23/02/18 09:57:23"
      }

      You can create object like this:
      $api = API(49);
      $api2 = API(50);
